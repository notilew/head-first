  <p>Well I made ir 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
    <li>Magic City, ID</li>
    <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
    <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    <li>Why, AZ</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Passing cars, <br> When you can't see, <br> May get you, <br> A glimpse, <br> Of eternity.
  </blockquote>

  <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't belive finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway. I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cell Phone</li>
    <li>IPod</li>
    <li>Digital Camera</li>
    <li>Protein Bar</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>.</p>
